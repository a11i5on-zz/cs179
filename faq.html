                  Mission

Y2Y Harvard Square, a student-run overnight shelter, employs a youth-to-youth model to provide a safe and affirming environment for young adults experiencing homelessness. Y2Y guests have opportunities to collaborate with service providers, other youth experiencing homelessness, and student volunteers to create sustainable pathways out of homelessness and develop skills for long-term success. Y2Y provides opportunities for both guests and volunteers to become the next generation’s leading advocates for youth-driven solutions to homelessness.


 <h5>Dignity </h5>

Dignity is for everyone. We believe everyone deserves to feel pride and self-worth, and we are committed to ensuring that all people are treated with the utmost respect and kindness.


 <h5>Safety </h5>

Our priority is to maintain an environment where everyone, including all our guests and volunteers, feel completely safe. We continually strive to ensure not only their physical safety, but their emotional safety as well. This is a space of comfort and trust.


 <h5>Adaptibility  </h5>

We never stop growing and improving. Quantitative and qualitative surveys and assessments allow us to continually update and adapt our programming to ensure that we are providing the absolute best service possible.


 <h5>Collaboration  </h5>

Everything we do is a team effort, from day-to-day operations to advocacy and leadership. We thrive on a connected environment, bringing together the unique skills of expert service providers, community members, local institutions, motivated students, and talented young adults experiencing homelessness to achieve meaningful goals and create positive change.


 <h5>Affirmation  </h5>

We are open to all lived experiences and strive to create a non-judgmental, open, and affirming space for young people of all gender identities and sexual orientations.


Program Model


 <h5>SANCTUARY </h5>

We have more than doubled the number of easily accessible beds for young adults ages 18-24 in the Greater Boston area in order to provide a safe and affirming overnight environment that is welcoming to all young people.

Using a trauma-informed approach, we provide our guests with a safe overnight environment that is welcoming to everyone. Our space is gender-inclusive, with a staff dedicated to ensuring that all young people feel safe and comfortable accessing our services.


 <h5>PATHWAYS </h5>

We serve as an entry point to critical resources for young adults by providing referrals to partner service providers. Student volunteers advised by faculty and professionals offer programming in legal aid, career readiness, and creative expression. Additionally, student case managers work with guests to access Y2Y’s extensive partner network for additional resources, including case management, job training, mentoring, mental health care, and permanent housing.


<h5> ADVOCACY </h5>

Together, Y2Y’s guests and student volunteers collaborate on advocacy initiatives to raise support for and awareness of young adult homelessness. Using program data, we will approach lawmakers and inform public understanding to promote policy decisions that direct increased attention and resources toward this pressing issue.

At the same time, our advocacy programming gives young adults experiencing homelessness the opportunity to become leaders in creating social change and to bring their own stories to light.
